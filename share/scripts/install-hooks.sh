#
# Merge the framework's lifecycle hooks into a Claude Code settings.json.
#
# Usage:
#   install-hooks.sh <settings.template.json> <settings.json> <project|user> [<addon hooks.json>...]
#
# - Add-on hooks.json files (plugin-mode format, "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/<name>.sh)
#   are merged after the template, with the script path swapped for the install's prefix.
# - Missing settings.json: created from the template.
# - Existing settings.json: backed up, then framework hooks are merged in.
#   Everything else (permissions, env, model, user-defined hooks) is preserved.
# - Re-running is idempotent: framework-owned hooks from a previous install are
#   replaced, not duplicated. Ownership = a command pointing at one of the
#   framework's script names under .claude/scripts/ (current or retired), or an
#   identical prompt hook. Retired hooks are removed, not re-added.
#
# In "user" mode, hook commands point at ~/.claude/scripts so they fire in every
# project; "project" mode keeps $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/scripts.
