# The Golden Triangle

Three short documents give Claude the business context the code cannot show. The project `CLAUDE.md` lists them under "Always load", so every session starts with them.

| Document | Path | Answers | Starting structure |
|----------|------|---------|--------------------|
| Business rules | `docs/context/business-rules.md` | What the system must enforce: prohibitions, money rules, authorization, data integrity | [business-rules.template.md](business-rules.template.md) |
| Architecture | `docs/context/architecture.md` | How it is built: layers, modules, boundaries, patterns, conventions | [architecture.template.md](architecture.template.md) |
| API contracts | `docs/api/api-contracts.md` | The request and response shapes, status codes, and error codes the Next.js frontend relies on | the `api-contracts.md` format in the `write-docs` skill |

The development process is not a fourth document. It lives in the kit itself (`/sdd`, specs, verification gates) and in the project's `AGENTS.md` (commands, red lines).

## Creating them

Generate them from the code, never from memory:

```
/write-docs --type=all                              # all three, every rule and contract cites file:line
/write-docs --type=business                         # one at a time
/write-docs --import <file|url> --as=business       # rules that already live in a wiki, PDF, or ticket
```

`write-docs` starts a missing business-rules or architecture document from the templates in this folder and fills it from the code. Generated business rules describe what the code does, which is not always what the business wants: each stays marked "needs human validation" until someone confirms it. For a new product, `/product-brief` writes the draft rules first (`BR-01`…); once the owner validates them, `docs/context/business-rules.md` keeps the same ids.

## Keeping them useful

- **Short.** One to three pages each. Long context gets skimmed, and skimmed rules are the ones that get broken.
- **One fact, one place.** Commands and red lines go in `AGENTS.md`, area conventions in `.claude/rules/*.md`, and only what is left in these three files.
- **Linked, not copied.** Summarize and link to schema docs (`docs/schemas/`), ADRs (`docs/adr/`), and specs for detail.
- **Checked.** `/write-docs --audit` reports rules that cite code that moved, endpoints missing from the contract, and docs that name removed classes.
- **Re-injected after compaction.** The post-compact hook prints the top of `business-rules.md` and `architecture.md` so a long session keeps the rules. Put the most important rules first.
