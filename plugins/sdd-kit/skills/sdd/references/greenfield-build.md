# Route: new app → greenfield-build

From an empty target to one shippable vertical slice. Later features go through the `feature` route.

## Args

| Arg | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `idea` | What the app/service does and what the first slice must prove. With a brief: the first backlog slice that is not shipped (Outcome, Entry point, BR ids). |
| `brief` | Path to `product-brief.md` from `/product-brief`. Read as the constitution; `backlog.md` next to it receives the next slices. |
| `stack` | `laravel`, `nextjs`, `drupal`, … |
| `repos` | `{ backend, frontend }` for split repos. |
| `url` | Dev-server URL for acceptance. |
| `force` | Allow scaffolding into a directory with tracked files (default refuses). |
| `models` | Per-run tier override. |

No `product-brief.md` yet? Offer `/product-brief` first (SKILL.md Step 4c). Ask before launching: stack, single vs split repos, the first slice, hard constraints (auth, data store, hosting). Have the user approve the architecture direction.

```
Workflow({ name: "greenfield-build", args: { idea: "SL-01: …", stack: "laravel", repos: { backend: "./api", frontend: "./web" }, url: "http://localhost:3000", brief: "product-brief.md" } })
```

## Phases

```
Detect        confirm the target is empty (tracked tree → BLOCKED unless force)
Constitution  product brief (scope, BR ids) + CLAUDE.md + skills as governing principles
Architecture  api-architect: stack, layout, data model, first slice; 3-vote verify against the constitution
Scaffold      framework skeleton with working gate tooling (Pest, Larastan, Pint; ESLint, tsc, Vitest,
              next build, Playwright when there is a UI journey), contract-sync for split repos;
              a gate that cannot run stops here (FIX-FIRST); then CI on devops-engineer; committed checkpoints
Slice         one vertical slice, TDD, backend before frontend
Gates         scaffold builds, slice passes tooling; auto-fix loop
Acceptance    trace the slice's user journey end-to-end
Handoff       getting-started.md, architecture.md (ADR), manual-test.md
Report        next slices appended to backlog.md (created if missing); SHIP-SLICE / FIX-FIRST / BLOCKED
```

## Outputs

A committed scaffold with working gates and CI, one working slice, the three handoff docs, and `backlog.md` with the built slice marked shipped and the next slices appended, each with its `/sdd` Run line (visible in `/spec-board`'s Backlog column).

## Done when

`SHIP-SLICE`: the slice passes gates and acceptance.

`FIX-FIRST` at Scaffold (a gate that applies to the skeleton cannot run; gates the scaffold deliberately skips, such as Playwright with no UI journey, do not count): the result carries `architecture`, `firstSlice`, and `next`. Do not re-run greenfield-build, even with `force`: it would re-decide the architecture and scaffold over the committed skeleton. Fix the tooling, then build the first slice with the `ship-feature` call in `next` (or `/sdd` with the same description, which routes it as a feature now that code exists).
