# backlog.md template

Copy everything inside the fenced block into `backlog.md`, next to `product-brief.md`. Replace the example content and delete the `<!-- -->` guidance once filled.

`backlog.md` is read by tools as well as people (spec-board's BACKLOG column, greenfield-build's Report appending its next slices), so keep its shape:

- One `### SL-nn · <title>` heading per slice under `## Slices`, in build order. Ids are stable; position is the order.
- Each slice is a bullet list of `- **Field:** value` lines in the order shown, ending with `- **Run:**`.
- `Status` is one of `proposed | approved | specced | shipped`. `specced` and `shipped` slices name their spec folder in `Spec:` (`greenfield-build` for a shipped first slice built without a spec); otherwise `Spec:` is `—`, including an approved first slice greenfield-build could not finish, so it stays in spec-board's Backlog column.
- `Depends on` (slice ids) and `BRs` are comma-separated ids, or `none`. `Blocked by` is a comma-separated list of `Q-nn` ids, `decision "<question>"` (or the ADR once written), and `external: <what>`, or `none`.
- `Ticket:` is optional; omit the line when there is no tracker key.
- New slices go at the end of the `## Slices` section, **before** `## Intake log` (spec-board stops reading slices at the next `## ` heading, so a slice appended at the end of the file disappears from the board). New Intake log rows go at the end of that table. Approved slices are never reordered.
