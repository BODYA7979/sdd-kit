# SDD Kit

Spec-driven development for **Claude Code and Codex**, using one shared set of workflows, skills, agents, templates and stack definitions. Host adapters handle installation and native execution; the project remains SDD Kit.

This branch extends the public 3.1.0 distribution with shared development entry points. The author's release pipeline still generates its distribution from a separate source repository; integrating this work there is a future upstream step. See [architecture and contribution boundaries](docs/architecture.md).

## Codex and shared development

From the repository root, with Node 20+, bash, jq and a Codex CLI that supports plugins:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
node cli/sdd-kit.mjs install --host codex
```

Start a fresh session, review hooks with `/hooks`, and use `$sdd`. This installs `sdd-kit@sdd-kit` with native Codex subagents. [Codex installation, recovery and limitations](docs/hosts/codex.md).

`npm test` validates both host packages. `node cli/sdd-kit.mjs build --host all` builds them from `plugins/` and `share/`. Shared behavior is edited once; only host API differences belong in `adapters/`. See [validation results and limits](docs/validation.md). Claude's existing installation methods below continue to work, and the common CLI accepts `install --host claude` explicitly.

- [Interactive guide](https://stasmarkov.github.io/sdd-kit/), also in this repository's `docs/` folder
- [Worked example: Hireboard](https://github.com/stasmarkov/sdd-kit/blob/v3.1.0/docs/examples/job-board/README.md), a Laravel API and a Next.js frontend built ticket by ticket through every `/sdd` route

## Install as a Claude Code plugin

From inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add stasmarkov/sdd-kit
/plugin install sdd-kit-laravel-nextjs@sdd-kit
```

The `sdd-kit-laravel-nextjs` preset installs the core plus the Laravel and Next.js add-ons. For the stack-agnostic core alone, or to pick add-ons one by one:

```
/plugin install sdd-kit@sdd-kit
```

In plugin mode the workflows' browser steps use the plugin's own Playwright server and need no project `.mcp.json` entry: see [Playwright in plugin mode](https://stasmarkov.github.io/sdd-kit/reference/installation.html#playwright-in-plugin-mode).

To pin this release, add the marketplace at the tag:

```
/plugin marketplace add stasmarkov/sdd-kit#v3.1.0
```

If SSH access to GitHub is not set up, start Claude Code with `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_PREFER_HTTPS=1` so the marketplace is cloned over HTTPS.

### Updates

To pick up a new release, run `claude plugin update <name>@sdd-kit` for each installed plugin, then `/reload-plugins` in a running session.

Auto-update is off by default for this marketplace. To turn it on, open `/plugin`, choose Marketplaces, select `sdd-kit` and enable auto-update. To update by hand:

```
claude plugin marketplace update sdd-kit
claude plugin update sdd-kit@sdd-kit
```

## Install by copying files

Clone this repository and run the installer from your project root:

```
bash /path/to/sdd-kit/install.sh --project --dry-run
bash /path/to/sdd-kit/install.sh --project
```

Every flag works (`--minimal`, `--full`, `--stack=<stack>[,<stack>]`, `--with=<addon>`, `--prune`, `--yes`, `--user`). `--stack` stages the add-ons for a stack (for example `--stack=laravel,nextjs`) and `--prune` removes installed add-ons that are not selected on an upgrade. Without cloning, run it through npx:

```
npx github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit install --project --dry-run
npx github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit install --project
```

## Run with npx

These need Node 18+ and git. The package is not published to npm. The commands differ by npm version.

npm 11:

```
npx github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit spec-board --serve
npx github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit install --project
npx github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit guide
```

npm 12 blocks git dependencies unless you allow them, so add `--allow-git=root`:

```
npx --allow-git=root github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit spec-board --serve
npx --allow-git=root github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit install --project
npx --allow-git=root github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit guide
```

To run the `spec-board` binary by package name, use the `-p` form:

```
npx -y -p github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit spec-board
npx --allow-git=root -y -p github:stasmarkov/sdd-kit spec-board
```

The first line is for npm 11, the second for npm 12.

Supported npm versions: 11 and 12. npm 10 is not supported. Append `#v3.1.0` to the repository name to pin this release.

## Plugins

Stack-agnostic core; stacks come from add-on plugins. | `/plugin install sdd-kit@sdd-kit` |

Install an add-on with `/plugin install <name>@sdd-kit`.

## Stacks and roadmap

The core is stack-agnostic: each stack is described by a `stack.json` manifest that an add-on ships, and `/new-stack` scaffolds one. This release is built and tested for a Laravel API with a Next.js frontend; the Drupal and iOS add-ons exist but are early. More stacks are on the roadmap. The manifest format is in the [stack manifest reference](https://stasmarkov.github.io/sdd-kit/reference/stack-manifest.html).

## Original release provenance

The following describes the original author releases, not this branch’s development commits. Every release is one commit on `main`, made by the release pipeline through the GitHub API and shown as Verified by GitHub. Its message names the source commit it was built from (`release: v3.1.0 from <source>@<sha>`), and that commit carries a GPG-signed release tag checked against the maintainer's key before anything is built. The tags `v3.1.0` and `<plugin>--v3.1.0` point at the release commit.
